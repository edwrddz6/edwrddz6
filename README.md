# Welcome to Edward's GitHub Page!

## Hello, I'm Edward, a full-stack developer student passionate about learning and collaboration. I enjoy coding, playing guitar, exercising, traveling, and playing with my dog in my free time!

## As of now, I'm currently honing my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, and React. I'm eager to collaborate on projects to help me apply and enhance my skills. Let's connect and build something great together!
