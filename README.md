# Welcome to Edward's Github Page!

## Hello, I'm Edward, a web developer with a passion for learning and collaboration. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, exercising, traveling, and hanging out with my Alaskan Malamute!

## As of now, I'm currently honing my skills in front-end technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I'm eager to collaborate on projects to help me apply and enhance my skills. Let's connect and build something great together!
