Hello, I'm Edward, a web developer with a passion for learning and collaboration.

I'm currently honing my skills in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks such as React and Vue.js. Also, I'm exploring Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and SQL on the back end.

I'm eager to collaborate on projects to help me apply and enhance my skills. Whether it's e-commerce, social networking, or content management systems, I'm interested in making a real-world impact.

Let's connect and build something great together!
